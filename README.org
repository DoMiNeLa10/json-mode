#+TITLE: json-mode â€” a JSON editing mode

This is a simple JSON editing mode for Emacs.

* Features
- Folding of Objects and Arrays (=C-c C-f= to toggle next one, =C-c C-u= to
  unfold everything)
- Pretty printing files (=C-c C-p=) (by default when file is opened as well,
  ~json-mode-pretty-print-on-open~ can be set to ~nil~ to disable this)
- Minification (=C-c C-m=)
- Validation (=C-c C-v=)

* Installation
The easiest way to install this mode is to simply put it somewhere in
~load-path~ and add
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'json-mode)
#+END_SRC
to your init file.

Files with =.json= extension will be opened with this mode by default.

This mode has autoload comments, so it should work nicely with lazy loading
setups.

* Known problems
- Pretty printing and minifying replaces ~{}~ with ~null~
